<h3 class="center">Anonymous File Hosting: Who Owns the Content?</h3>
<p>&emsp;Governments should not be allowed to hold site owners accountable for user uploaded content.  The 2012 issue surrounding the file hosting site, Megaupload, showed a clear transgression of government power.  The site was shut down due to allegations of copyright infringement after having been accused of the crime for a long time.  The allegations were publically presented after the protests of SOPA and PIPA, two bills that were aimed at fighting online piracy and protecting intellectual property.</p>
<p>&emsp;In response to Megaupload being censored, many other websites joined together in protest by either displaying a black bar across their logo or by voluntarily censoring their site.  This had a dramatic effect on how people viewed censorship by interrupting normal users from accessing resources they depended on.  While the actions taken by the group Anonymous may seem irresponsible, the message of defeating undue censorship on the web was loud and clear to everyone affected.</p>
<p>&emsp;The biggest complaint with Megaupload being shut down, however, was that people who used the service legitimately lost their files.  Although complaints were filed to try and retrieve those files, ultimately they were not allowed as the servers that hosted the site were being held as part of an ongoing investigation.  Many people questioned why the government had the right to shut down the site, while others who ran similar sites began to question the business of hosting files for users.  Ultimately, users lost all files they had uploaded with no chance of retrieval.</p>
<p>&emsp;While the situation with Megaupload could have been handled with more tact than it was, it brought about many questions about the legality of hosting files.  The New York Times wrote in an article that “the operators knew the site contained unauthorized content” and that “this should scare the owners and operators of similar sites.”  Regardless of this statement, the government should go after the account holder and not the site operator for the sole reason that the owner of the site might not know what content has been uploaded by a user.</p>

<h3 class="center">Bicycles: The Next Frontier for Cardboard</h3>

<p>&emsp;Bicycles are an amazingly efficient form of transportation.  Over the years, people have looked for ways to make them more affordable, stronger, and lighter.  A man by the name Izhar Gafni has managed to do all three by constructing a bicycle made entirely from recycled materials, most of that being cardboard.  Development of this recycled bicycle didn’t happen overnight.  It took Gafni almost two years to perfect manufacturing techniques that would make his invention a reality.</p>
<p>&emsp;This cardboard creation, known as the Alfa Bike, is made from ninety-nine percent recycled material, ninety percent of that being recycled cardboard.  There are no metal parts involved in its construction and is weather-proof due to a resin coating on the cardboard.  While cardboard may not seem like an ideal construction material, its properties lend itself to solid construction.  “The idea is like Japanese origami. You fold it once and then it doesn’t become twice the strength, it’s almost three times the strength.”</p>
<p>&emsp;How cool would it be to go down to the store and buy a bicycle for less than it costs to go out to a restaurant?  Having the ability to afford a bicycle on any budget would impact the bicycle market enormously.  There would still be a market for high-end road and mountain bikes, but it would offer a highly affordable option for the casual rider or low-income individual.  The Alfa Bike could also be easily rolled out to poorer countries as an effective means of cheap transportation.</p>
<p>&emsp;Speaking of poorer countries, the Alfa Bike is cheap to produce.  At around $9 for an adult frame and $5 for a kids frame, the price to produce it means that it would be an inexpensive product no matter what the market.  If it were to come to market tomorrow, perhaps the amount of stolen bikes would decrease.  In areas where public transportation is limited or carpooling has proven ineffective, the Alfa Bike could fill a gap in the bicycle market that until now has been almost impossible to address.  Even with a markup of double the manufacture cost, the price would undercut anything else on the market.</p>
<p>&emsp;There are many markets where this bike would prove highly successful, from low-income markets to casual riders looking for a cheap bike.  While the idea of a cardboard bike might seem absurd, the fact that it's built from almost one-hundred percent recycled materials means that it would also be environmentally friendly.  When the word "bicycle" is said, however, cardboard would not immediately come to mind as a suitable building material due to it being a paper product.  Izhar Gafni is proving that no matter the material, a good engineer can change the collective perception of quality and cost.  Whereas steel, titanium, and other alloys are more durable and might therefore be regarded as better, in the case of an affordable bicycle, it is being proven that cardboard construction can be just as resilient as a metal while being more affordable overall.  This bicycle is just the beginning of how we will perceive durable and cost-effective engineering in the future.</p>

<h3 class="center">Linux and the Legal World</h3>

<p>&emsp;Throughout the history of Linux there have always been legal battles, be it with patents or with the licensing of source code.  Intellectual property, while important in the business world, starts to fall apart when code is published publically.  Coding replacements for closed source products, while challenging, can sometimes mean the difference between innovation and stagnation.  From drivers in the kernel to licensing issues with resources, Linux has been plagued with legal battles for as long as it has existed.</p>
<p>&emsp;Large companies frequently push out new products and are faced with a choice: do we use a proprietary operating system and drive up the overall cost of the product or use a Linux distribution and keep the cost down.  When the choice to use Linux prevails, some steps must be taken in order to avoid legal action.  Any source code that the company modifies that is licensed with one of the open source licenses must be released to the public in order to avoid legal action from the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  The sole purpose of this is the idea of giving back to the community that did the initial work and to drive interest in the product.  Who knows, maybe a freelance developer can find a way to make the product better at no cost to you.</p>
<p>&emsp;While many companies respect the licensing of source and do give back in a timely manner, there is still a long way to go to ensure that all companies are abiding by the rules.  From foreign companies creating Android devices and failing to release kernel source to network device manufacturers using full Linux distributions and not releasing anything, the biggest legal shortcoming is not putting pressure on these companies to respect the work of the Linux community.  So please, if you find yourself with a device that runs Linux, ask the manufacturer for the code.  If they won.t give it up, talk to your friends at the FSF and help keep the innovation rolling.</p>
