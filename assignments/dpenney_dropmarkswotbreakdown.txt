1) S.W.O.T. Analysis on Dropmark

Strengths:
- Easy to use, provides a simple user interface that is easy to understand.
- Allows for uploads of various media types.
- Quick, uploading and viewing files is near instantaneous.
- Can upload directly to it from many applications.

Weaknesses:
- File size is only 1GB, could be problematic if you want to share large archives.
- Amount of storage space provided not easily findable.

Opportunities:
- Quick and easy, could be implemented into workflow instantly.
- Free and paid, if we want to try it to see how it works, it wouldn't cost anything.

Threats:
- Maybe too simple, it's really only a simple storage medium.
- Not accessible without internet connection.

2) S.W.O.T. Analysis on Dropbox

Strengths:
- Touts strong security, files are AES-256 encrypted.
- Access to the site is via https, not plain http.  Nothing is sent as plain-text.
- You can undelete files easily.

Weaknesses:
- Expensive for a paid subscription, only allows 5 users on the business and pro plans before having to pay more.
- Very small file size (300MB).  This is however offset by a 2GB storage limit for free plan.

Opportunities:
- Can be used without paying, cost-effective in that regard.
- Files are synced automatically, everyone would have the most recent changes instantly (more or less).

Threats:
- Files can't be updated without an active internet connection.
- Desktop application can be slightly buggy.

3) Identify the main similarities and differences with both software applications.

Similarities:
- They both allow for uploads of most all media types.
- Changes are near-instantly viewable remotely.
- Both allow for free usage.

Differences:
- DropBox seems to be more security oriented, partners with many companies already.
- Storage limit and maximum file size, could be important if our needs are extreme.

4) Dropbox would be my choice because of it's focus on security and the fact that they maintain an easily viewable list of partners that take advantage of their services already.
