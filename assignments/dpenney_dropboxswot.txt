S.W.O.T. Analysis on Dropbox

Strengths:
- Touts strong security, files are AES-256 encrypted.
- Access to the site is via https, not plain http.  Nothing is sent as plain-text.
- You can undelete files easily.

Weaknesses:
- Expensive for a paid subscription, only allows 5 users on the business and pro plans before having to pay more.
- Very small file size (300MB).  This is however offset by a 2GB storage limit for free plan.

Opportunities:
- Can be used without paying, cost-effective in that regard.
- Files are synced automatically, everyone would have the most recent changes instantly (more or less).

Threats:
- Files can't be updated without an active internet connection.
- Desktop application can be slightly buggy.
