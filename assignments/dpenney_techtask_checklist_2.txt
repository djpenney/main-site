1. What was the technical subject matter that you learned today?
Digital Footprints

2. What task were you given to complete in order to demonstrate your competency level today as it relates to the technical subject matter?  Were you able to complete all the task assigned to you?
The task assigned was to complete a SWOT analysis on 3 different application providers that allow your website to generate revenue and to create a website that established a "digital footprint".  Completing the task was not an issue.

3. How would you rate yourself based on today's technical deliverable that you were given: beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert and please explain why?
I would rate myself as advanced because I was able to complete the assignment with minimal effort while still remaining clear and concise.

4. Please document step by step what you did in order to complete today's assigned deliverable.
a) Research various advertising, e-commerce, and donation/payment sites and create a SWOT analysis for the three chosen.
b) Set up a vhost on my web server and added in a DNS entry to no-ip to give myself a strong digital presence.
c) Utilize the code from my project website to jumpstart my Year Up site.

5. After today's lesson plan, in your own words describe exactly what it is you learned today and how you can apply this information towards an IT internship.
I learned a bit outside of the assignment in that I set up a vhost for the first time and that in the areas of work I'm looking at getting in to, this is a basic yet crucial bit of knowledge.

6. What do you feel you can do to improve your performance in the technical focus area we covered today?
Keep doing what I know.  I maintain a small digital footprint to keep tracking companies from learning too much about me.
