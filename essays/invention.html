<h3 class="center">Bicycles: The Next Frontier for Cardboard</h3>

<p>&emsp;Bicycles are an amazingly efficient form of transportation.  Over the years, people have looked for ways to make them more affordable, stronger, and lighter.  A man by the name Izhar Gafni has managed to do all three by constructing a bicycle made entirely from recycled materials, most of that being cardboard.  Development of this recycled bicycle didn’t happen overnight.  It took Gafni almost two years to perfect manufacturing techniques that would make his invention a reality.</p>
<p>&emsp;This cardboard creation, known as the Alfa Bike, is made from ninety-nine percent recycled material, ninety percent of that being recycled cardboard.  There are no metal parts involved in its construction and is weather-proof due to a resin coating on the cardboard.  While cardboard may not seem like an ideal construction material, its properties lend itself to solid construction.  “The idea is like Japanese origami. You fold it once and then it doesn’t become twice the strength, it’s almost three times the strength.”</p>
<p>&emsp;How cool would it be to go down to the store and buy a bicycle for less than it costs to go out to a restaurant?  Having the ability to afford a bicycle on any budget would impact the bicycle market enormously.  There would still be a market for high-end road and mountain bikes, but it would offer a highly affordable option for the casual rider or low-income individual.  The Alfa Bike could also be easily rolled out to poorer countries as an effective means of cheap transportation.</p>
<p>&emsp;Speaking of poorer countries, the Alfa Bike is cheap to produce.  At around $9 for an adult frame and $5 for a kids frame, the price to produce it means that it would be an inexpensive product no matter what the market.  If it were to come to market tomorrow, perhaps the amount of stolen bikes would decrease.  In areas where public transportation is limited or carpooling has proven ineffective, the Alfa Bike could fill a gap in the bicycle market that until now has been almost impossible to address.  Even with a markup of double the manufacture cost, the price would undercut anything else on the market.</p>
<p>&emsp;There are many markets where this bike would prove highly successful, from low-income markets to casual riders looking for a cheap bike.  While the idea of a cardboard bike might seem absurd, the fact that it's built from almost one-hundred percent recycled materials means that it would also be environmentally friendly.  When the word "bicycle" is said, however, cardboard would not immediately come to mind as a suitable building material due to it being a paper product.  Izhar Gafni is proving that no matter the material, a good engineer can change the collective perception of quality and cost.  Whereas steel, titanium, and other alloys are more durable and might therefore be regarded as better, in the case of an affordable bicycle, it is being proven that cardboard construction can be just as resilient as a metal while being more affordable overall.  This bicycle is just the beginning of how we will perceive durable and cost-effective engineering in the future.</p>
