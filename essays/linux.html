<h3 class="center">Linux and the Legal World</h3>

<p>&emsp;Throughout the history of Linux there have always been legal battles, be it with patents or with the licensing of source code.  Intellectual property, while important in the business world, starts to fall apart when code is published publically.  Coding replacements for closed source products, while challenging, can sometimes mean the difference between innovation and stagnation.  From drivers in the kernel to licensing issues with resources, Linux has been plagued with legal battles for as long as it has existed.</p>
<p>&emsp;Large companies frequently push out new products and are faced with a choice: do we use a proprietary operating system and drive up the overall cost of the product or use a Linux distribution and keep the cost down.  When the choice to use Linux prevails, some steps must be taken in order to avoid legal action.  Any source code that the company modifies that is licensed with one of the open source licenses must be released to the public in order to avoid legal action from the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  The sole purpose of this is the idea of giving back to the community that did the initial work and to drive interest in the product.  Who knows, maybe a freelance developer can find a way to make the product better at no cost to you.</p>
<p>&emsp;While many companies respect the licensing of source and do give back in a timely manner, there is still a long way to go to ensure that all companies are abiding by the rules.  From foreign companies creating Android devices and failing to release kernel source to network device manufacturers using full Linux distributions and not releasing anything, the biggest legal shortcoming is not putting pressure on these companies to respect the work of the Linux community.  So please, if you find yourself with a device that runs Linux, ask the manufacturer for the code.  If they won.t give it up, talk to your friends at the FSF and help keep the innovation rolling.</p>
