<h3 class="center">Anonymous File Hosting: Who Owns the Content?</h3>
<p>&emsp;Governments should not be allowed to hold site owners accountable for user uploaded content.  The 2012 issue surrounding the file hosting site, Megaupload, showed a clear transgression of government power.  The site was shut down due to allegations of copyright infringement after having been accused of the crime for a long time.  The allegations were publically presented after the protests of SOPA and PIPA, two bills that were aimed at fighting online piracy and protecting intellectual property.</p>
<p>&emsp;In response to Megaupload being censored, many other websites joined together in protest by either displaying a black bar across their logo or by voluntarily censoring their site.  This had a dramatic effect on how people viewed censorship by interrupting normal users from accessing resources they depended on.  While the actions taken by the group Anonymous may seem irresponsible, the message of defeating undue censorship on the web was loud and clear to everyone affected.</p>
<p>&emsp;The biggest complaint with Megaupload being shut down, however, was that people who used the service legitimately lost their files.  Although complaints were filed to try and retrieve those files, ultimately they were not allowed as the servers that hosted the site were being held as part of an ongoing investigation.  Many people questioned why the government had the right to shut down the site, while others who ran similar sites began to question the business of hosting files for users.  Ultimately, users lost all files they had uploaded with no chance of retrieval.</p>
<p>&emsp;While the situation with Megaupload could have been handled with more tact than it was, it brought about many questions about the legality of hosting files.  The New York Times wrote in an article that “the operators knew the site contained unauthorized content” and that “this should scare the owners and operators of similar sites.”  Regardless of this statement, the government should go after the account holder and not the site operator for the sole reason that the owner of the site might not know what content has been uploaded by a user.</p>
